# P2-Sales-Prediction

This project will use sales data given by a client in order to predict whether a client would or would not buy a product. Possible attributes that could be used include gender age and estimated salary. The aim is to use a machine learning model to make predictions that would ultimately provide insight on the stores sales and a possible reason for their drop. The performance measure will be F1 score.
